======================================
Adjust Priority for Replica Set Member
======================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

The priority settings of replica set members affect the outcomes
of :doc:`elections </core/replica-set-elections>` for primary. Use this
setting to ensure that some members are more likely to become primary and
that others can never become primary.

The value of the member's
:rsconf:`members[n].priority` setting determines the
member's priority in elections. The higher the number, the higher the
priority.

Considerations
--------------

To modify priorities, you can connect to any replicaset member (not a mongos).
Changes you make there will be picked up by other replica set members.

After connecting, you update the :rsconf:`members`
array in the replica configuration object. The array index begins with
``0``. Do **not** confuse this index value with the value of the replica
set member's :rsconf:`members[n]._id` field in the
array.

The value of :rsconf:`members[n].priority` can be any
floating point (i.e. decimal) number between ``0`` and ``1000``. The
default value for the :rsconf:`members[n].priority`
field is ``1``.

To block a member from seeking election as primary, assign it a priority
of ``0``. :ref:`Hidden members <replica-set-hidden-members>`,
:ref:`delayed members <replica-set-delayed-members>`, and :ref:`arbiters
<replica-set-arbiters>` all have
:rsconf:`members[n].priority` set to ``0``.

Adjust priority during a scheduled maintenance window. Reconfiguring
priority can force the current primary to step down, leading to an
election. Before an election the primary closes all open :term:`client`
connections.
